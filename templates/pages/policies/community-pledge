                        At BuyCars.Africa, we recognize that we are not merely building a marketplace; we are stewarding a digital gateway to one of the continent’s most vital industries. Integrity is our primary currency.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="fw-bold text-dark mt-5 mb-3">1. Radical Integrity</h4>
                    <p>
                        We believe every buyer deserves a marketplace free from corruption. We institutionalize a zero-tolerance policy regarding bribery and fraud through our <strong>Anti-Bribery & Corruption (ABC) Policy</strong>. Furthermore, our secure, anonymous <strong>Whistleblowing Portal</strong> ensures the sanctity of our "Verified Dealer" status remains absolute.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="fw-bold text-dark mt-5 mb-3">2. Environmental Stewardship</h4>
                    <p>
                        We acknowledge the automotive industry's carbon footprint and commit to paying that debt back to the African soil. For every vehicle successfully sold, we fund the planting of <strong>25 indigenous trees</strong>. We are not just selling cars; we are actively building Africa’s future natural heritage.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="fw-bold text-dark mt-5 mb-3">3. Digital Empowerment</h4>
                    <p>
                        We believe technology should be a bridge, not a barrier. Through our <strong>Dealer Academy</strong>, we provide regional merchants with world-class digital tools to scale their businesses. Our infrastructure meets <strong>TIER III Design</strong> and <strong>ISO 27001</strong> standards, providing a bank-grade foundation for local trade.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="fw-bold text-dark mt-5 mb-3">4. Data Sovereignty</h4>
                    <p>
                        Your digital identity is a private asset. We strictly adhere to regional <strong>Data Protection Acts</strong>, ensuring that every financial record and personal detail is secured with global <strong>PCI DSS</strong> standards.
